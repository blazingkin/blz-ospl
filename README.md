[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blazingkin/blz-ospl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blazingkin/blz-ospl)

An assembly-like interpreted language that implements both imperative and functional programming schema.

Currently implemented in Java, but will eventually transition to being a directly compiled language.

The language will change drastically right now as I build up feature-completeness and polish it.
